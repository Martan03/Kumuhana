## Description

I tried creating my own VSCode theme and this is how it came out:

Kumuhana is dark theme for VSCode with cyan accents (I might add option to
change accent color later). This theme will evolve over the time as I find
problems or come up with good idea to make it even better.

Kumuhana is dark theme for VSCode with cyan accents. Syntax highlighting was
heavily inspired by my [friend](https://github.com/BonnyAD9), so thanks! :)

## Suggestion

If you like this theme, you can also use
[my Firefox style](https://github.com/Martan03/clean-fox) that uses similar
design options.

## Installation:

You can download the theme on
[VSCode Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Martan03.kumuhana)
